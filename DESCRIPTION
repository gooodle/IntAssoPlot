Description: IntAssoPlot, an R package, provides improved visual display of GWAS results in a publication-ready format. The main panel of a IntAssoPlot plot contains connecting line link the relative association p-values on the -log10 scale, the genome annotation, and the linkage disequiblism (LD) matrix. Inspection of the output image can provide important biological information including locis that passed the genome-wide significant threshold, genes harbored or located near the significant loci, and the extent of LD within the selected region.
